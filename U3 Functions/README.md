WELCOME TO UNIT 3: FUNCTIONS

### I honestly don't know what it refers with functions, I'm assuming is programming related
This section is a W. I. P. I haven't done anything in this unit yet; which means it won't have as much fancy stuff as you'd like to see until later. This time I've even made the image myself :) .

### Preview  
Images about the software executing. A preview in other words. ![WIP](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/shrug-del-hombre-de-negocios-267725.jpg)
### Summary
Short explanation about what the executable does.
### Explanation
Detailed explanation about how the software works.
Maybe I can even add the steps I took to make the program. Like this:
> Step one: Do this  
> Step two: ???  
> Step three: Done  
### Sources (If any)
In case I consult additional sources to help the realization of the project.
